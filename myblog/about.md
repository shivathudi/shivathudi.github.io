Hi! I’m Shiva, a data science enthusiast graduating from the University of San Francisco’s Masters in Analytics program in June 2017. This blog lets me keep track all the data science and data visualization projects I’ve worked on so far.

I currently work part-time as a data science intern at [Vungle][vungle-link], where I’ve been since October 2016. Vungle provides in-app video advertising technologies to both advertisers and publishers in the mobile app industry.
